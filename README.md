# Neural Network Library in JavaScript

### Overview
Developed a neural network library from the ground up in JavaScript, implementing core machine learning concepts like feedforward and backpropagation. The library leverages stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the model's parameters, enabling efficient training.

### Features
- Customizable neural networks with flexibility in:
  - Number of layers
  - Number of neurons per layer
  - Activation functions
- Efficient training using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Allows experimentation with various neural network architectures
- Supports training models on diverse datasets
- Provides insights into the internal workings of neural networks

### Use Cases
This project enables building neural networks for a wide range of applications, making it suitable for:
- Learning and understanding neural network mechanics
- Experimenting with different architectures
- Practical machine learning implementations in JavaScript environments
